## Become a Validator
Immunefi_MATIC uses Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of work  (PoW) 
merge (PoC) new consensus model. It means that the network’s security and stability is maintained by a set of network validators. Anyone can become a validator and receive MATIC as a reward while contributing to network security.

## What validators do
Network validators verify all user transactions. If all validators reach consensus that a transaction is valid, it is included in the blockchain. Invalid transactions are rejected.

## Rewards
Users send a small surplus amount of MATIC to their transaction that represents a reward to validators for their work. This amount is distributed proportionally to the stake of validators elected in the given validation cycle.
In addition, if the verifier makes special contributions during the verification process, additional coin rewards will be generated.These also go to validators. 


## Penalties
There are two ways validators can be penalized: idle and malicious misbehaving; both of which are prohibited and may result in being fined for their actions.

If a validator does not participate in block creation and transaction signing for a significant amount of time during a validation round, it is potentially fined. As of April 2024, the Standard fine accrued is 101 MATIC.

Any network participant can file a complaint if they believe a validator is misbehaving. During this process, the participant issuing the complaint must attach cryptographic proofs of misbehavior for Elector submission. All validators operating on the network check the validity of complaints and vote whether they will pursue the complaint collectively. Upon reaching 66% validator approval, a slashing penalty is deducted from the validator and withdrawn from the validator’s total stake.

## How to become a Validator
Becoming a validator requires access to high-performance hardware (PoW)on a highly available network, as minimum 300  MATIC as a stake(PoS). Validators stake MATIC for a fixed specific term, And receive coin rewards after the verification round is completed.

Use Immunefi_Poc_Authenticator, a convenient open-source tool for validators. Upon installation you can use it to manage your nodes easily.
